With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms.

This collection of stories features animal characters which are stereotyped to associate certain qualities with them. The origins of the Panchatantra lie in a tale of its own, when a King approached a learned pandit to ask him to teach the important lessons of life to his ignorant and unwise sons. This learned scholar knew that the royal princes could not understand complex principles in an ordinary way. So, he devised a method wherein he would impart important knowledge in the form of simple and easy-to-understand folktales.\r\n\r\nThus, the Panchatantra came into origin. It is one of the most popular collection of Indian tales, and has influenced literature all over the world since the time of its conception. This particular version of the Panchatantra was translated by G L Chandiramani, who has also translated the Hitopadesha. Panchatantra comes from the individual words, ‘pancha’ and ‘tantra’. While pancha refers to the number five, tantra refers to ways/strategies related to inner fulfilment.\r\n\r\nThe stories in this book aim to impart the deeper wisdom of life, through the simple portrayal of animal characters. The story of two geese and an tortoise is dedicated to the moral of heeding a trusted friend’s advice.

Human beings are flawed and limited—\"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.\" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them.

Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are Freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and Communication our ancestors couldnt even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness. What’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s mark manson. In 2016, manson published the subtle art of not giving a f*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries. Now, in everything is f*cked, manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the Internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom even of hope itself. With his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.', 'English', 224);
